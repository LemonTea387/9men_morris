# Nine Men's Morris - The Everything Team (Documentation)
This page contains the developer source code documentation 
for the Nine Men's Morris game created by the Everything 
team for the FIT3077 unit, Semester 1, 2023.

To get started, take a look at the `Classes` tab and select `Class List`.
This will bring you to a page will all the (documented) classes so far in the project.
Select any and you will see information such as the documented member functions, attributes,
relationships with other classes, etc.

For Developers: Since we're mostly familiar with Java, I set up the configuration for the documentation
to follow the Javadoc format. Please follow the Javadoc format. Also note I enabled `JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF` 
so that the first sentence in a documentation string is the "brief" summary version of it. See the
[Doxygen documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) on how to follow the format.
